Redesigned WalletConnect UX for Seamless Onboarding

The objective of this project is to improve the current UX design for cloud.walletconnect.com and create a cohesive user onboarding experience that allows for self-onboarding without requiring assistance. The goal is to ensure that users can easily recognize and use WalletConnect products, understand the next steps after each action, be aware of their progress, and complete the onboarding process seamlessly.

We crafted a new prototype for the entire onboarding process using Figma👇
